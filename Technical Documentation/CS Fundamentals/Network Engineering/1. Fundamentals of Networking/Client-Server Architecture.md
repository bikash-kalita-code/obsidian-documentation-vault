- Machines are expensive, applications are complex
- Separate the application into two components
- Expensive workload can be done on the server
- Clients call servers to perform expensive tasks
- Remote procedure call (RPC) was born

### Client-Server Architecture Benefits
- Servers have beefy hardware
- Clients have commodity hardware
- Clients can still perform lightweight tasks
- Clients no longer require dependencies
- However, we need a communication model
