In Unsupervised Learning, we are given with data that aren't associated with any output labels Y. 
Supervised learning learn from data labeled with the "right answers" while Unsupervised Learning find something interesting in unlabeled data.

Data only comes with inputs **x**, but no output labels **y**. Algorithm has to find **structure** in the data.

Some of the major types of Unsupervised Machine Learning are:

| Clustering | Anomaly Detection | Dimensionality reduction |
| - | - | - |
| Group similar data points together | Find unusual data points | Compress data using fewer numbers |
