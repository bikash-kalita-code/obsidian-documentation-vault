It refers to algorithms, that learn on X(input) to Y(output label) or input to output mappings. The key characteristics of Supervised Learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from (learn from being given 'correct answers'). 
It learns from being given "right answers".

| Input (X) | Output (Y) | Application |
| - | - | - |
| email | spam? (0/1) | spam filtering |
| audio | text transcripts | speech recognition |
| English | Spanish | machine translation |
| ad, user info | click? (0/1) | online advertising |
| image, radar info | position of other cars | self-driving cars |
| image of phone | defect? (0/1) | visual inspection |

The two major types of Supervised Learning are:

| Regression | Classification |
| - | - |
| predict a number | predict categories |
| infinitely many possible outputs | small number of possible outputs |
