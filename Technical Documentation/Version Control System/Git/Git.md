- Git is a free and open-source version control system, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.

## Git commands
#### Git add
Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.
#### Git branch
This command is your general-purpose branch administration tool. It lets you create isolated development environments within a single repository.
