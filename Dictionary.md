- **Agnostic** : In computing, a device or software program is said to be agnostic or data agnosticÂ if the method or format of data transmission is irrelevant to the device or program's function. This means that the device or program can receive data in multiple formats or from multiple sources, and still process that data effectively. ^2fe824
